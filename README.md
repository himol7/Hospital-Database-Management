# Hospital-Search-Management-System

In this Project, we have tried to manage a database containing data about all the hospitals and clinics in a city, in a particular area, treatments offered at the hospital, all doctors in a city, in a particular area, their specializations, experience, ratings, affiliations with various hospitals, availability of doctors at a hospital, book appointments.<br/>

This database can be used by the user to find a hospital or clinic that best fits the user’s requirements and affordability. The user can compare fees charged by various hospitals and doctors. The database can be used in cases of emergency in order to get best and nearest doctors, based on the current availability of the respective doctor. Moreover, the user can request an appointment online by looking at the available timings of the doctor, the status of which is also a part of the “Hospital Search Management System” Database.<br/>

Furthermore, the doctors who reach their retirement age are automatically deleted from the database, making the database efficient.
Hence, the user will be able to apply all the filters which are possible and fulfills his/her requirements and sort them in ascending and descending order according to his/her convenience.
